**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - **Game Logic and GUI Separation:**  The logic for the game (like checking for a winner, switching players) is now more separated from the GUI code. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.
   - **Private Methods:** Methods like `_create_game_elements`, `_setup_gui_callbacks`, `_check_winning_pattern`, `_color_board`, and `_color_winning_sequence` are now prefixed with an underscore.  This convention indicates they are intended for internal use within the class and not to be called directly from outside the class. 
   - **Data Hiding:** The game board (`self.game_board`) and other game state variables are now more encapsulated within the `TicTacToeGame` class.

2. **Method Extraction:**
   - The code for checking for a winning pattern has been moved into its own method (`_check_winning_pattern`), making the `check_for_winner` method more concise.
   - The code to color the board has been extracted into two methods: `_color_board` for coloring the entire board and `_color_winning_sequence` for coloring just the winning sequence.

3. **Initialization and Restart:**
   - The `restart_game` method now handles resetting the game to its initial state, making it clearer what happens when the game is restarted.
   - Game elements are initialized in the `_create_game_elements` method, called at the beginning and during a restart.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

- **Increased Modularity:** The code is now broken down into smaller, more manageable units (methods), making it easier to understand, test, and modify.
- **Improved Reusability:** The extracted methods, like `_check_winning_pattern`, can be potentially reused if you were to extend the game (e.g., create a larger game board).
- **Enhanced Maintainability:**  Separating the GUI logic from the game logic makes it easier to make changes to one without affecting the other.
- **Better Readability:** The code is now more organized and easier to follow.
